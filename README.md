# jsdu

Like ncdu but for JSON files.

Ever tried to open a big JSON file with your favorite text editor, only for it to start lagging?
Maybe it opened fine but it's minified and you don't know what are you looking at?

Worry not, jsdu will help you make sense of it.

## Install

```
cargo install jsdu
```

## Usage

```
# Open JSON file in interactive mode
jsdu bigFile.json
```
